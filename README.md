This repository contains an example Java project configured to use Jlink
which bundles a minimized Java 11 runtime with the app so that the Java runtime
is not required to be installed on the OS in the traditional sense (i.e. it ignores
JAVA_HOME and instead uses the JRE that comes with the app).

Jlink includes only the parts of the JRE which the app requires. This can be a
significant savings in disk space. The full JRE is aprox 300MB, whereas the jlink'd
JRE for this demo is around 30MB.

# Build instructions

Compile the project and build the native image with the following command:

`$ mvn clean package`

# Run instructions

And then run the native image with the following autogenerated launcher script:

```
$ cd target/maven-jlink/
$ ./bin/jlinkdemo
Hello World!
```
